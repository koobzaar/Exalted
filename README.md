Urgent:

- [ ] Fix the issue that it takes a lot of time to open the program for the first time because of the active downloads of data dragon files - maybe download them all at the same time?
- [x] Cache the catalog and the last commit in case of skin change
- [ ] Fix the issue that .exe files are not unpacked on dist (maybe I need to download directly from cslol)
- [x] Make a alert to tell the user that the injection was successful
- [x] Make a animation for the "play" button (that will probably be changed)
- [x] Prompt the user for the lol installation folder on first run
- [ ] Write a more beautiful alert
- [ ] Add a better way to show the selected skin/chroma - that border sucks

Needs to be worked later:

- [x] Fix an issue that cslol modtools injection tool doesn't return if the injection is active (therefore there's no actually way to know if worked or not)
- [x] Make the first champion active on program loads (show Aatrox skins)
