Urgent:
- [ ] Fix the issue that it takes a lot of time to open the program because of the active downloads of data dragon files
- [ ] Fix the issue that .exe files are not unpacked on dist (maybe i need to download directly from cslol)
- [ ] Make a alert to tell the user that the injection was successful
- [ ] Make a animation for the "play" button (that will probably be changed)
- [ ] Prompt the user for the lol installation folder on first run

Needs to be worked later:

- [ ] Fix an issue that cslol modtools injection tool doesn't return if the injection is active (therefore there's no actually way to know if worked or not)
- [ ] Make the first champion active on program loads (show Aatrox skins)
